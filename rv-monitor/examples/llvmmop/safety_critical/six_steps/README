Linux:
 To build the monitoring library bitcode and the assisting Makefiles
  ../../../../bin/rv-monitor -c -llvm six_steps.rvm
 
 The above generates 4 files:
 *__RVC_SixSteps_Monitor.bc (monitoring library bitcode),
 *aspect.map (information for instrumentation), 
 *Makefile.instrument (make file for performing the instrumentation)
 *Makefile.new (make file to deal with both compilation and instrumentation)

  Makefile.new should be renamed as Makefile
   mv Makefile.new Makefile

 To build the tests without monitoring
    
  make

 To run the unmonitored tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 On stdout a succession of Step and complete messages are printed.
 Nothing is printed on the stderr stream.

 To instrument the tests for monitoring, after building normally
  
  make instrument

 To run the instrumented tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 The output of these tests on the stderr stream should be the same as in 
 test_1/test1.output and test_2/test2.output 

 To remove monitoring code (without fully rebuilding):
   make uninstrument

 To clean the workspace:
   make clean
