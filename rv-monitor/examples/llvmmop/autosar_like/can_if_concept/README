This test is a minimal version of the following open-source Autosar CanIf implementation:
http://code.google.com/p/gainos/source/browse/GaInOS_Based_On_uTenux-tkernel/gainos/uTenux/autosar/autosar/comstack/CanIf/?r=29
and checks for certain properties required to conform to the AUTOSAR API.

 To build the monitoring library bitcode and the assisting Makefiles
  ../../../../bin/rv-monitor -c -llvm can_if.rvm
 
 The above generates 4 files:
 *__RVC_Can_If_Monitor.bc (monitoring library bitcode),
 *aspect.map (information for instrumentation), 
 *Makefile.instrument (make file for performing the instrumentation)
 *Makefile.new (make file to deal with both compilation and instrumentation)

  Makefile.new should be renamed as Makefile
   mv Makefile.new Makefile

 To build the tests without monitoring
    
  make

 To run the unmonitored tests
  ./test_1
  ./test_2
  ./test_3
 
 Nothing should be printed for the unmonitored tests as they don't have 
 output.

 To instrument the tests for monitoring, after building normally
  
  make instrument

 To run the instrumented tests
  ./test_1
  ./test_2
  ./test_3
 
 The output of these tests on the stderr stream should be the same as in 
 canif_1/test_1.output, canif_2/test_2.output, canif_3/test_3.output  

 To remove monitoring code (without fully rebuilding):
   make uninstrument

 To clean the workspace:
   make clean
