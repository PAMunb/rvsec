 This property specifies a case in which a pointer is
 dereferenced without checking whether it is NULL.
 It is monitored for the match condition.

 We use lr rather than lalr because we are monitoring
 for matching rather than failure

 To build the monitoring library bitcode and the assisting Makefiles
  ../../../../bin/rv-monitor -c -llvm is_null.rvm
 
 The above generates 4 files:
 *__RVC_IsNull_Monitor.bc (monitoring library bitcode),
 *aspect.map (information for instrumentation), 
 *Makefile.instrument (make file for performing the instrumentation)
 *Makefile.new (make file to deal with both compilation and instrumentation)

  Makefile.new should be renamed as Makefile
   mv Makefile.new Makefile

 To build the tests without monitoring
    
  make

 To run the unmonitored tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 The sum should be printed correctly, but no monitoring output.

 To instrument the tests for monitoring, after building normally
  
  make instrument

 To run the instrumented tests
  ./test1
  ./test2
 
 The output of these tests with monitoring should be the same as in 
 test_1/test1.output and test_2/test2.output 

 To remove monitoring code (without fully rebuilding):
   make uninstrument

 To clean the workspace:
   make clean
