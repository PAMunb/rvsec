To run this agent (which consists of more than 200 Java API properties
developed thus far by RV Inc), simply replace "java" in your command with
"rv-monitor-all" to run any Java program against all these properties,
with no further configuration.

Several examples of both correct and incorrect programs are provided in
this directory.  To run them, simply use "javac [example].java" followed
by "rv-monitor-all [example]".  The violation of any of the included
properties should be displayed to the screen, along with an explanation of
the violated property.

To run the agent manually (without the included script) simply add
-javaagent:rv-monitor-all.jar to the Java command required
to run any program.  Make sure the RV-Monitor lib folder is added to
your classpath.
