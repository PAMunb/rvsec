  This property simulates a basic car using operations on a struct.
  It uses an extended regular expression to ensure proper sequencing of car events,
  and checks basic post and preconditions of certain events.  It instruments the code
  using AspectC (www.aspectc.net), allowing for the car-related source code to be entirely
  separate from the RVMonitor event handling code.

Linux:

To run basic_car_1_aspc execute the following commands:

../../../../bin/rv-monitor -c -p basic_car.rvm

acc basic_car_1_aspc/basic_car_acc.acc basic_car_1_aspc/basic_car.mc

gcc basic_car_1_aspc/basic_car.c basic_car_1_aspc/basic_car_acc.c __RVC_Basic_Car_Monitor.c -o basic_car

./basic_car
