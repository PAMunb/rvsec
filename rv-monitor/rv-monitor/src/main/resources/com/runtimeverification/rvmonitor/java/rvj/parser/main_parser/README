Make sure not to add the realKind field declaration (see code below) to Token.java when regenerating it.
realKind is a hack needed by the main_parser.

 /**
   * Hand added to solve some generics-related problems with angle brackets.
   * Should be added back whenever Token.java is regenerated by javacc.
   */
  public int realKind;
