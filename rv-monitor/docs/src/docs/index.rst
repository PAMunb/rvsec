========

RV-Monitor is a software analysis and development framework and tool that
aims at reducing the gap between specification and implementation by allowing
them together to form a system.
With RV-Monitor, runtime monitoring is supported and encouraged as a
fundamental principle for building reliable software: monitors are
synthesized from specifications and integrated into the original 
system to check its behavior during execution.
