## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load}
bench02mop <- read.csv("mop-report.csv", head=T, sep=",")
bench02cc  <- read.csv("cc-report-converted.csv", head=T, sep=",")
bench02cg <- read.csv("cg-report-converted.csv", head=T, sep=",")

gt <- read.csv("bench02-gt-converted.csv", head=T, sep=",")

gt <- na.omit(gt)

nrow(bench02mop)
colnames(bench02mop)

nrow(bench02cc)
colnames(bench02cc)

nrow(bench02cg)
colnames(bench02cg)

colnames(gt)
nrow(gt)
```

```{r descriptive}
sqldf("select distinct spec from bench02mop order by 1")
sqldf("select distinct spec from bench02cc order by 1")
sqldf("select distinct spec from bench02cg order by 1")


sqldf("select spec, count(*) from bench02mop group by spec")
sqldf("select spec, count(*) from bench02cc group by spec")
sqldf("select spec, count(*) from bench02cg group by spec")


sqldf("select error, count(*) from bench02mop group by error")
sqldf("select error, count(*) from bench02cc group by error")
sqldf("select error, count(*) from bench02cg group by error")
```

## Ground Truth (CC)

```{r}

## Examples of FP and FN 

```{r}
# false positive 
sqldf("select distinct className

       where className in (select class from tn)")



# false-negative
